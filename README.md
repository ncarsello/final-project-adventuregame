# Adventure Game By: Nicholas Carsello, Kurt Diall, and Ethan Mohan
The final project group consists of Nicholas Carsello, Kurt Diall, and Ethan Mohan. The email of Nicholas Carsello is ncarsello@luc.edu. Outside class, we will make meetings Wednesday and Thursday nights weekly and through Google Docs and Slack as well.

In our adventure game, our user will come across obstacles while embarking on a journey. They will make choices and the end result will be decided on what they choose. Some of these obstacles will be choosing where to go, what to eat, what to do when encountering another person, et cetera. The user will come across some items along the way and store them, including food, weapons, and gifts possibly.

This game will be in Java. It will involve a queue list in regards to collecting the items. It will also involve linked lists, since there will be more than one possibility for the outcome.

Possible milestones would be working on completing individual scenarios, hopefully in two weeks time. Another milestone would be linking individual files together.

The game will go something alone the lines of this.
